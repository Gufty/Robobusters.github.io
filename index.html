								<p>Elliott Elmore - Team Captain<br>
									Hi! I'm the team captain for this team and I'm a senior. I joined robotics in fourth grade, and have kept at it all the way through middle and high school. As the captain my role is to create an environment where everyone can have a great year of robotics filled with learning and fun. Outside of robotics I powerlift, play video games, watch youtube, and read comics. <br><br>
							Rosa Martinez Diaz - Programmer<br>
									I started robotics in the 3rd grade, with inspiration from my older brother. He quitted soon, but I found a passion for competing in VEX. I continued for the following years only stopping for the pandemic. I was unsure about Vex V5, but I would love to learn more about coding so I signed up! I landed on the C team and am learning a whole new world of robotics. I like to read, and write poetry. I also like to be nerdy about video games.<br><br>
							Adrian Sarmiento - Driver<br>
									I started robotics in 6th grade because I really like robots and I wanted to learn more on how to build robots and how they work. I quickly became the driver of the team after proving myself in multiple competitions. After a very successful robotics career in middle school, I decided that I wanted to continue doing robotics in high school and I joined the VRC robotics club to continue doing what I love. Outside of robotics I am a one year self taught pianist and I enjoy playing all the songs that I have learned to people.<br><br>
							Nicholas Sanchez  - Communications<br>
									My interest in robotics began in fifth grade when my bestfriend and I joined because we thought it looked fun. Throughout my 7th and 8th grade year I gained another level of respect and passion for robotics. Throughout my highschool experience I had always wished to return to robotics but was so busy until my senior year. Outside of robotics I’ve found interests in spending time with friends and family, volunteering with my church, swimming competitively, and just remaining active in general with stuff like running and going to the gym.<br><br>                     
							Brandon Vazquez  - Build Lead<br>
									I got into robotics in 7th grade, where I took a course on it. I never joined a robotics competition club until I began high school, however. Unfortunately covid struck and I wasn’t able to really participate in the team until 10th grade, where I would mainly focus on building. 11th grade, when our team switched to vex, is when I really started to be really active in robotics. With smaller teams in vex, I was able to have more of an impact on my team, which led me where I am today in this team. Outside of robotics I enjoy practicing my guitar skills and I’m in the esports club.<br><br>
							Lesley Martinez-Aviles - Backup<br>
									My first time in Robotics was in 5th grade. Over time I shifted away from the club due to fear of standing out, but knew high school was the time to beat that fear and decided to join again as a Senior. Outside of Robotics I take part in other organizations like Students Demand Action, Junior World Affairs Council, and League of United Latin American Citizens.</p>

								<p>Aneek Singh - Programmer<br>
									Yo, I am the 597D programmer and my role is to make sure the robot has the proper control, and system code to perform. I really love computer science and have done a lot of projects within that field. I really love working with AI especially language comprehension and computer vision. I love weightlifting, video games, and manga as well.<br><br>
								Alexander Enriquez - Builder<br>
									Hi, I am the builder for this team, my role is to make sure we have a developed and working robot for competitions. I like to play video games and read manga, I am interested in computers and I intend on pursuing computer engineering in college. I love the different aspects of building hardware and how their software works which contributed to the reason as to why I am in robotics<br><br>
								David Perez - Programmer/Builder/Driver<br>
									Hi, I am the 597D programmer, builder, and driver, and I play many roles in the team. I mainly build, as I am great at programming and finish programming the robot quickly, and I also drive at competitions alongside Samuel.<br><br>
								Samuel Hinojosa - Driver<br>
									Hi, I am the driver for this team, my role for the team is to drive the robot in competitions but also help with building the robot or whatever is needed in meetings. I am interested in computer science and am interested in pursuing it in college. I like to play video games with friends, read manga, and listening to music. <br><br>
								Alexander Ipina - Backup<br>
									Hello, I’m the backup for this team, I help out with everything and anything that I can with. If someone can’t make it to a competition, I take their place. I’ve always been interested in robotics and this is my second year doing VRC. I like playing the piano and playing video games. I plan to pursue a career within the STEM area.<br><br>
								Ismael Enriquez - Team Captain<br>
									Hi, I am the team captain for this team and my role is to assure that we have the best possible time in robotics, all while learning, building and coding our robot. I really love computer science and as college gets closer and closer, I get more and more excited about learning more about computer science. I love to play video games and read manga during my free time.</p>
